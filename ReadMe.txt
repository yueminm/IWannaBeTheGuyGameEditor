I Wanna Be The Guy Game Editor

Description: 
This project is based on I Wanna Be The Guy, a popular adventure game series on Steam.
In the original game, the player named Kid should pass several difficult and tricky levels to win. In those levels, there are visible thorns that the player should not touch, enemies that the player can shoot, and invisible traps (apples) that only appear when the player gets close to it. Besides jumping to avoid colliding with the traps and enemies, the player can also shoot the enemies to make them disappear and shoot the checkpoints so that they can restart from the checkpoints in case they die later.
In this project, all these basic game functions are kept. Instead of having pre-designed playing levels, now players start from designing their own levels and then play. Therefore, this project allows players to show their creativity as well as have fun while playing.
